# Scanline display thing
I've always thought scanline displays looked cool. Im going use this project to explore how these interfaces worked, but mainly to have a lens to expand my knowledge of rendering primitive shapes. My goal is to have a few shapes (mainly circles/ellipses) which are rasterized and then displayed. I will not be using any built in functions/libraries for rasterisation, i'd like to build it up myself from a single setPixel() function. The math seems pretty interesting. 

This project uses the Processing Java library. The jar is included in the project files (core.jar).
